# How to Test the Accounting Module

## Sample Data Available

I've added sample accounting data to **TWO** businesses:

1. âœ… **EuropaTech BE** - UUID: `329e0405-b544-5051-8d37-d0143e9c8829`
2. âœ… **Work Bench Ltd UK** - UUID: `0f6c4e64-9b50-5e11-a7d1-1923b7aef282`

Both businesses now have identical sample data:
- 40 Chart of Accounts
- 12 Journal Entries (all posted)
- 1 Accounting Period (Fiscal Year 2025)
- Updated account balances

## How to Switch Between Businesses

### Option 1: Check Your Current Business
The application shows which business you're currently working with in the top navigation or dashboard.

### Option 2: Switch Business (if available in UI)
Look for a business selector/dropdown in your application header or settings.

### Option 3: Verify Current Business via Database
Run this to see which business is in your session:
```sql
SELECT uuid_business_id FROM users WHERE email = 'admin@admin.com';
```

## Step-by-Step Testing Guide

## Troubleshooting

### If you don't see the data:

1. **Check you're on the right business**:
   ```sql
   -- See which business your session is using
   SELECT * FROM businesses;
   ```

2. **Verify data exists**:
   ```sql
   -- For EuropaTech BE
   SELECT COUNT(*) FROM accounts WHERE uuid_business_id = '329e0405-b544-5051-8d37-d0143e9c8829';
   ```

3. **Check permissions**:
   ```sql
   -- Verify admin has accounting permissions
   SELECT permissions FROM users WHERE email = 'admin@admin.com';
   -- Should include: 45,46,47,48,49,50,51,52
   ```

### If reports show $0 or empty:

1. **Check accounting period is set**:
   - Go to `/accounting-periods`
   - Verify Fiscal Year 2025 is marked as "Current"

2. **Verify journal entries are posted**:
   ```sql
   SELECT entry_number, is_posted FROM journal_entries
   WHERE uuid_business_id = '329e0405-b544-5051-8d37-d0143e9c8829';
   ```
   All should have `is_posted = 1`

3. **Check account balances updated**:
   ```sql
   SELECT account_code, account_name, current_balance
   FROM accounts
   WHERE uuid_business_id = '329e0405-b544-5051-8d37-d0143e9c8829'
   AND account_code IN ('1010', '1020', '4010')
   ORDER BY account_code;
   ```
