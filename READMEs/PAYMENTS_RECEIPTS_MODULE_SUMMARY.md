---

## Overview

Created a complete **Payments and Receipts module** for recording money in (receipts) and money out (payments), fully integrated with the **Chart of Accounts** for proper double-entry bookkeeping, Trial Balance, and Balance Sheet reporting.

---

## Database Tables Created

### 1. ✅ `payments` Table

**Purpose:** Track all money going out (supplier payments, expense payments, refunds)

**Key Features:**
- Unique payment numbers (PAY-000001, PAY-000002, etc.)
- Links to suppliers, invoices, and bank accounts
- Multiple payment methods (Bank Transfer, Cheque, Cash, Cards, PayPal)
- Automatic journal entry creation when posted
- Remittance advice PDF generation support

**Table Structure:**
```sql
CREATE TABLE `payments` (
  id, uuid, uuid_business_id,
  payment_number,        -- PAY-000001
  payment_date,          -- Date of payment
  payment_type,          -- Supplier Payment, Expense, Refund, Other
  payee_name,            -- Who is being paid
  payee_type,            -- supplier, employee, other
  payee_uuid,            -- Links to suppliers/employees
  invoice_uuid,          -- Links to purchase_invoices
  invoice_number,        -- Reference invoice number
  amount,                -- Payment amount
  currency,              -- GBP, USD, EUR
  payment_method,        -- Bank Transfer, Cheque, Cash, etc.
  bank_account_uuid,     -- Links to accounts table
  reference,             -- External reference (cheque #, transaction ID)
  description,           -- Payment description
  status,                -- Draft, Pending, Completed, Cancelled
  is_posted,             -- 0 or 1 (posted to journal)
  journal_entry_uuid,    -- Links to journal_entries
  created_by, created_at, modified_at
)
```

**Journal Entry Integration:**
When posted, creates double-entry:
```
Debit: Accounts Payable    £1,000
  Credit: Bank Account            £1,000
```

---

### 2. ✅ `receipts` Table

**Purpose:** Track all money coming in (customer payments, sales receipts, deposits)

**Key Features:**
- Unique receipt numbers (REC-000001, REC-000002, etc.)
- Links to customers, invoices, and bank accounts
- Multiple payment methods
- Automatic journal entry creation when posted
- Payment receipt PDF generation support

**Table Structure:**
```sql
CREATE TABLE `receipts` (
  id, uuid, uuid_business_id,
  receipt_number,        -- REC-000001
  receipt_date,          -- Date of receipt
  receipt_type,          -- Customer Payment, Sales Receipt, Deposit, Other
  payer_name,            -- Who is paying

  status,                -- Draft, Pending, Cleared, Cancelled

```

**Journal Entry Integration:**
When posted, creates double-entry:
```
Debit: Bank Account           £1,200

```

## Models Created

### 1. ✅ Payments_model.php

---

### 2. ✅ Receipts_model.php

**Location:** `ci4/app/Models/Receipts_model.php`

**Key Methods:**
- `getNextReceiptNumber()` - Auto-generate REC-000001, REC-000002
- `getReceiptsWithDetails()` - List all receipts with filters
- `getReceiptByUuid()` - Get single receipt with bank account details
- `postToJournal()` - Create journal entry when receipt is posted

## Chart of Accounts Integration

### How It Works:

1. **Payment Posted:**
   ```
   Payment: £1,000 to Supplier

   Journal Entry Created:
   ----------------------
   Debit:  Accounts Payable (2100)    £1,000
   Credit: Bank Account (1020)                £1,000

   Effect:
   - Reduces liability (we owe less)
   - Reduces cash (money went out)
   ```

2. **Receipt Posted:**
   ```
   Receipt: £1,200 from Customer

   Journal Entry Created:
   ----------------------
   Debit:  Bank Account (1020)        £1,200
   Credit: Accounts Receivable (1100)         £1,200

   Effect:
   - Increases cash (money came in)
   - Reduces asset (customer owes less)
   ```

3. **Trial Balance Integration:**
   - All posted payments/receipts flow to journal entries
   - Journal entries update account balances
   - Trial Balance reads from account balances
   - Always balanced (Debits = Credits)

4. **Balance Sheet Integration:**
   - Bank accounts show correct balances
   - Accounts Receivable reflects outstanding customer payments
   - Accounts Payable reflects outstanding supplier payments
   - Cash flow is tracked accurately

---

## Menu Items Added

✅ **Payments** - `/payments` (Icon: fa-money-bill-wave)
✅ **Receipts** - `/receipts` (Icon: fa-receipt)

Both added to menu table and ready for admin permissions.

SELECT * FROM receipts LIMIT 1;
DESC receipts;

-- Check menu items
SELECT * FROM menu WHERE link IN ('/payments', '/receipts');
