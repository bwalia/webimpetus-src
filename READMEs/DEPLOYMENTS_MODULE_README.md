# Deployments Module

## Overview
The Deployments module is a comprehensive deployment tracking system for managing service deployments across DTAP (Development, Testing, Acceptance, Production) environments. It provides complete visibility into deployment activities, links to related tasks and incidents, and maintains detailed deployment history.

## Features

### Core Functionality
- **DTAP Environment Support**: Track deployments across all four environments
- **Service Integration**: Link deployments to specific services
- **Task & Incident Tracking**: Connect deployments to related tasks and incidents
- **Version Control Integration**: Git branch, commit hash, and repository tracking
- **Deployment Types**: Initial, Update, Hotfix, Rollback, Configuration
- **Status Tracking**: Planned, In Progress, Completed, Failed, Rolled Back
- **Priority Levels**: Low, Medium, High, Critical

### Advanced Features
- **Approval Workflow**: Optional approval requirements with approver tracking
- **Downtime Management**: Track scheduled downtime windows
- **Health Monitoring**: Health check URL and status tracking
- **Rollback Planning**: Document rollback procedures
- **Deployment Notes**: Technical documentation and execution details
- **Affected Components**: Track all impacted systems

### UI Components
- **List View** with:
  - Summary cards showing deployment statistics
  - Color-coded environment badges
  - Status indicators
  - Priority flags
  - Filterable data table

- **Edit/Add Form** with 4 organized tabs:
  1. General Information
  2. Technical Details
  3. Links & Approval
  4. Downtime & Health

## Usage Examples

### Creating a Deployment

**Via UI:**
1. Navigate to `/deployments`
2. Click "Add New Deployment"
3. Fill in required fields:
   - Deployment Name
   - Environment
4. Optionally add:
   - Linked Service
   - Related Task or Incident
   - Git details
   - Approval requirements
   - Downtime windows
5. Save

**Via API:**
```bash
POST /api/v2/deployments
{
  "deployment_name": "Deploy User Service v2.1",
  "uuid_business_id": "xxx-xxx-xxx",
  "uuid_service_id": "yyy-yyy-yyy",
  "environment": "Production",

- Track deployment history per service
- Service-level deployment statistics

### 2. Tasks Module
- Connect deployments to deployment tasks

## Best Practices

### Deployment Planning
1. Always create deployment records in "Planned" status
2. Link to related tasks for scheduled deployments
3. Link to incidents for emergency deployments
4. Document rollback plans for Production deployments

### Production Deployments
1. Set `approval_required = 1`
2. Fill in `downtime_start` and `downtime_end` if applicable
3. Document `affected_components`
4. Add comprehensive `deployment_notes`
5. Test `health_check_url` after deployment

### Version Control
1. Always include `git_commit_hash`
2. Specify `git_branch`
3. Link to `repository_url`
4. Use semantic versioning in `version` field

### Post-Deployment
1. Update status to "Completed" or "Failed"
2. Set `completed_date`
3. Update `health_check_status`
4. Add any lessons learned to `deployment_notes`

## Navigation

The Deployments module is accessible from the left-hand navigation menu under "Deployments" (with rocket icon ðŸš€).

## Permissions

Users need appropriate permissions in the `menu` table to access the Deployments module. The menu entry is:
- Name: Deployments
- Link: /deployments
- Icon: fa fa-rocket

## Summary Cards

The list view displays 4 summary cards:
1. **Total Deployments** - All deployments count
2. **Completed** - Successfully completed deployments
3. **In Progress** - Currently deploying
4. **This Month** - Deployments in current month

## Environment Badges

Deployments are color-coded by environment:
- **Development** - Blue
- **Testing** - Yellow
- **Acceptance** - Pink
- **Production** - Green

## Future Enhancements

Potential additions:
- Deployment pipeline visualization
- Automated deployment triggers
- Integration with CI/CD tools
- Deployment metrics and KPIs
- Deployment calendar view
- Email notifications
- Deployment approval workflow
- Rollback automation
