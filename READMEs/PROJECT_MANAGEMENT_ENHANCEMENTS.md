## 💻 CODE EXAMPLES

### Creating a Tag
```php
POST /tags/save
{
    "name": "High Priority",
    "color": "#f59e0b",
    "description": "Important project or customer"
}
```

### Attaching Tags to Project
```php
POST /tags/attach
{
    "entity_type": "project",
    "entity_id": 123,
    "tag_ids": [1, 5, 8]
}
```

### Getting Entity Tags
```php
GET /tags/getEntityTags/project/123
Response: {
    "status": true,
    "data": [
        {"id": 1, "name": "Urgent", "color": "#ef4444"},
        {"id": 5, "name": "Web Development", "color": "#3b82f6"}
    ]
}
```

---

## 📈 METRICS CALCULATION

### Active Projects
```javascript
status === 'active'
```

### On Track Projects
```javascript
status === 'active' && (deadline >= today || progress >= 80)
```

### At Risk Projects
```javascript
status === 'active' && deadline < today && progress < 80
```

### Completion Rate
```javascript
avgProgress = totalProgress / projectCount (excluding cancelled)
```

---

## 🔐 SECURITY

✅ **Multi-tenancy**: All queries filtered by `uuid_business_id`
✅ **Tag Isolation**: Tags are business-specific
✅ **Junction Tables**: Unique constraints prevent duplicates
✅ **Delete Cascade**: Removing tag removes all associations

---

## 📱 RESPONSIVE DESIGN

- **Desktop**: Full Kanban board with 4 columns side-by-side
- **Tablet**: 2 columns per row in Kanban
- **Mobile**: 1 column, vertical scrolling
- **Summary Cards**: Auto-wrap based on screen size
